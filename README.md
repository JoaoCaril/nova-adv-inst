# Nova Advanced Instrumentation Applications

**Lab support materials**

Here the students of MIEF and MIEBM can find the Lab Lessons for the first remote and presential labs. The project will be developed on the final 3 labs. Each lab declares the requirments to execute the lab and what should be prepared by the student.  The remote labs require the submission of a pdf in moodle demonstrating the execution of the lab.

## Lab Work - Presential Work
